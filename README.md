# Masters_thesis

This is some work from my master's thesis which involved phenological modeling of Finnish moths. I am mainly putting this here as an example of my abilities and will include the pdf of my master's thesis as well as the grade I received. 

I didn't save some of the files, so this is not the entirety of the project, and the modelling file is not the final one, since the most recent version I could find was from March 1st. Still, it should show some of what I'm capable of, even if some of the exploratory analysis and data processing is missing.

The code will not be able to be run, because I cannot share the data, as it is the property of the Finnish government and is confidential.
